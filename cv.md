### About Myself:

Having started my career as a marketer in a trading company in Russia, I became interested in internet marketing, in particular, creating digital content for the commercial needs of the customer. Having independently mastered the editors of vector and raster graphics, I gained experience in the implementation of advertising campaigns as an employee of the largest car dealer in my home state. In addition, I have been successful as a freelance digital content designer for many commercial companies.

As an internet marketer, I have implemented several projects on online support for new car brands in the region, digitalization and automation of the process of interaction between a client and the car dealership. I gained experience with web analytics and website promotion in search engines.

Having moved to the USA, I got a great opportunity to improve my English skills. While working as a technical support specialist, I gained the skills to work in a big team on customer support. I gained a strong experience in finding solutions to technical software issues and general problems with a user's game account.

My desire to improve professionally and realize the existing background led me to the RS school, as a community in which I can get relevant skills of practical work in front-end. Realizing myself as a professional developer is my goal.
